Collection of Ansible custom facts.

== Instructions

Create the defined

directory, `/etc/ansible/facts.d` by default.
Place any local ansible `.fact` files in that directory and the executable files
in this directory will be run.  If the file is not executable it will be read.
The fact file output must be formattable in JSON.

== Repository rules

Every `.fact` file must must include a description, have a `.j2` template
and/or a `.yml` task example.
